Serendipity is an unplanned fortunate discovery. The term was coined by Horace Walpole in 1754.[1]

The concept is often associated with scientific and technological breakthroughs, where accidental discoveries led to new insights or inventions. Many significant discoveries in history were serendipitous, including penicillin, Post-it notes, Popsicles, and the microwave oven, arising from unforeseen circumstances that were then recognized and capitalized upon.[2][3][4]
Definition

Christian Busch views serendipity as "active luck", where chance encounters and human action come together. A missed flight or a casual walk in the park can lead to new friendships, interests, or even career opportunities.[5][6]

While serendipity in popular usage is often understood as a matter of pure chance, scientific discussions emphasize the crucial role of human agency—recognizing, interpreting, and acting upon unexpected opportunities. This interaction between chance and conscious action has been a key theme in areas such as creativity, leadership, innovation, and entrepreneurship.[6][7][8]
Etymology

The first noted use of "serendipity" was by Horace Walpole on 28 January 1754.[9] In a letter he wrote to his friend Horace Mann, Walpole explained an unexpected discovery he had made about a painting of Bianca Cappello, which he recently received by Mann as a gift. The finding regarded the coat of arms of the Cappello family and was categorised by reference to a Persian fairy tale, The Three Princes of Serendip.[10] The princes, he told his correspondent, were "always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of."[11] The name comes from Serendip, an old Persian name for Sri Lanka (Ceylon), hence Sarandib by Arab traders.[12] It is derived from the Sanskrit Siṃhaladvīpaḥ (Siṃhalaḥ, Sinhalese + dvīpaḥ, island), meaning Isle of the Sinhalas.[13]

The word has been exported into many other languages, with the general meaning of "unexpected discovery" or "fortunate chance".
